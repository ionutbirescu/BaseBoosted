Hello!

BaseBoosted is an application developed for a college project. We worked on this project on creating a database suitable for storing data about songs, artists and their albums, which can be used by a music providing app. We used SQL for creating the tables and Oracle APEX for developing the application.

However, as our Oracle APEX workspace for the project was purged, we decided to re-create the application using Java and MySQL. But there is the documentation and the scripts for the original project in BassBoosted_PDF.
